# Telegram animal channels
Website available: https://deer-spangle.github.io/telegram-animals/

This is a website to list all the channels on telegram which post pictures, gifs, and videos of various animals.  
I created this after I was running a few gif channels on telegram ([@deergifs](https://t.me/deergifs) and others) to see which other animals had channels posting pictures, gifs, and videos.

If you would like to add a new channel or bot, feel free to submit a pull request adding to telegram.json
